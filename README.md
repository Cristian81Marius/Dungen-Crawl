    <h1>Survive Game</h1>

    <p>
      This is a game created using object-oriented programming in units. The objective of the game is to survive as long as possible while facing two types of monsters: spaceships and reptiles. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The difficulty of the game increases with time as more monsters spawn around the player. To fight against the monsters, the player character uses a drone to throw lasers and destroy them. The power of the character increases as they gain experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, the player can collect objects from the ground to increase their health and attack.
    </p>

    <p>
      The game also has a unique feature where the player can teleport by pressing the 'ctrl' key. The game takes place on an infinite map, allowing players to move around freely.
    </p>

    <h2>How to Play</h2>

    <p>
      To play the game, simply download the game files and run the main executable. The game will start automatically, and the player can use the arrow keys to move around the map. The player can use the 'space' key to fire lasers at the monsters.
    </p>

    <p>
      To pick up an object, move the player character onto the object and press the 'p' key.
    </p>

    <p>
      To teleport, press the 'ctrl' key and click on the desired location on the map.
    </p>

    <h2>Object-Oriented Programming</h2>

    <p>
      This game was created using object-oriented programming principles. Each object in the game is an instance of a class, and each class has its own properties and methods.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, the player character is an instance of the `Player` class, which has properties such as `x` and `y` coordinates, `health`, `experience`, and `power`. The `Player` class also has methods such as `move`, `fire`, and `pick_up_object`.
    </p>

    <p>
      Similarly, the monsters in the game are instances of the `Monster` class, which has properties such as `x` and `y` coordinates, `health`, and `power`. The `Monster` class also has methods such as `move` and `attack`.
    </p>

    <p>
      The game mechanics are managed by a `Game` class, which has methods such as `spawn_monsters`, `increase_difficulty`, and `generate_objects`.
